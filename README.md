# InventorySystem
An inventory system with a GUI for a fictional company written in Java. This was for a class with the first program
I have written in Java. The requirements/scenario for the school project is found below.

---------------------------------------------------SCENARIO------------------------------------------------------------

You are working for a small manfacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually
enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.
